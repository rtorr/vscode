# JS is JSX Workaround

When this extension is installed then all .js files are treated like .jsx files.

** Notice ** when you install this extension you will loose all the existing language support provided for .js files. Installing this extension only makes sense when you want to use jsx syntax inside JavaScript files.

When installing this extension it is recommended to use a linter like `eslint` to validate the .js files.
